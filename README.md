BEACH FIRE PERMITS: If fire danger allows, beach fire permits may be downloaded on our Point Reyes National Seashore website or search in your browser for "beach fire permits Point Reyes National Seashore". They may also be obtained at the Bear Valley Visitor Center, and may be used on any beach at Point Reyes National Seashore, includng Tomales Bay beaches. All beach fire must be out by 10PM.

FOOD STORAGE: Hike-in/Bike-In campgrounds (Coast, Wildcat, Glen and Sky) have steel food lockers. HOWEVER, steel food storage lockers are NOT rodent proof. It is advised that campers bring food protection devices such as bear canisters, or Kevlar food bags. Boat-in campers MUST bring food protection devices. Racoons are hungry and will go through packs and tents to find food, Keep all food or scented items in the bear canisters and the steel food lockers at all times.

old discourse draft
I have a gripe with AllTrails that I'm looking into improving. I am planning a backpacking trip and want to be able to either:

1) specify start and end points of my hike (2 nodes) and do a graph traversal of ways to find shortest path (or a list of possible paths).

2) Manually select each trail segment that I want to walk and calculate distance this way 

Here's a concrete example: 
My trip will be Bear Valley Visitor Center - Glen Campground - Coast Campground - Sky Campground - Bear Valley Visitor Center. When I search "Bear Valley to Glen Campground", I get https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/bear-valley-trail-to-glen-camp-loop but this is a loop so I have to manually inspect to see how far the segments are by zooming in 

What I've done so far: 
Using stock https://www.openstreetmap.org/ it is decently easy to "query features" and find the way associated with the trail that I'm going to be walking. Great, it sort of checks the box for 2). The problem with this is that the way is almost always too long and goes beyond the junction that I would split off at.
